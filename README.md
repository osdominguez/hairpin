# PGS Specs:

In hairpin/txt_files there are txt files for both the pcs and pvalues. These are new line delimited files that all the code reads in and is relative to. To add a new number of pcs or p-value threshold, just add a new line with the desired value. For formatting purposes please keep the numerically ascending order.
Then rerun the formatting scripts found in the txt_files directory
